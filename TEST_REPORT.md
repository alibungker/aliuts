## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Orphaned Program Studi Records ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Data integrity, dashboard charts

**Description**:
11 Program Studi records had no Fakultas assigned, causing:
- Broken Fakultas → ProgramStudi relationship
- Potential chart rendering issues
- Data inconsistency

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Assigned appropriate Fakultas to each Program Studi:
- TI, SI, TE, TM, TS, AR, AI → Fakultas Teknik
- MN, AK → Fakultas Ekonomi
- IK, PS → Fakultas Hukum
```

**Verification**: ✅ All 11 records now properly linked

---

### Issue #2: Template Block Mismatch ✅ FIXED (Previously)

**Severity**: Critical
**Impact**: Admin edit forms not rendering

**Description**:
- FakultasAdmin and 5 other admins used `form_bootstrap.html` directly
- Template had empty `{% block content %}`
- Forms didn't render on edit pages

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed all admin models to use `change_form.html`
- `change_form.html` properly extends `form_bootstrap.html` with content

**Verification**: ✅ All edit forms now working
